# Introduction

PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs. It can implement tensors and dynamic neural networks with strong GPU acceleration. Being one of the fastest and most flexible machine learning framework, PyTorch is extensively used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

## Key Features

### TorchScript

With TorchScript, PyTorch can soomthly switch between the eager mode and the graph mode. The former offers ease-of-use and flexibility, while the latter hightlights the speed, optimization, and functionality in C++ runtime environments.

### Distributed Training

Optimize performance in both research and production by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication that is accessible from Python and C++.

### Mobile

PyTorch supports an end-to-end workflow from Python to deployment on iOS and Android. The PyTorch API covers common preprocessing and integration tasks needed for incorporating machine learning in mobile applications.

### Tools & Libraries

An active community of researchers and developers have built a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries for extending PyTorch and supporting development in areas from computer vision to reinforcement learning.

### Native ONNX Support

Export models in the standard ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for direct access to ONNX-compatible platforms, runtimes, visualizers, and more.

### C++ Frontend

The C++ frontend is a pure C++ interface to PyTorch that follows the design and architecture of the established Python frontend. It is intended to enable research in high performance, low latency and bare metal C++ applications.

### Cloud Partners

PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling through prebuilt images, large scale training on GPUs, ability to run models in a production scale environment, and more.
